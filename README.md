Coding Challenge for Nextbase

Hey Sebastian and team! Over the last 2 evenings I have only been able to spare 6 hours for this
challenge and have completed all of the tasks except integration, widget and golden tests. I'm
experienced in these kinds of testing also and am confident I could add them to my solution - if you
need this please let me know and I will be able to complete this on Sunday evening for you to review
on Monday.

Some comments:
- in a real setting it would make sense to change the API response to include something like
totalNumberOfPages to simplify and improve performance (by making multiple concurrent calls)
- I haven't persisted the data in the repository layer in the interests of time but have experience
doing so using multiple packages including SQFLite, Hive and Moor
- I would have formatted the chart axes better by using custom tick providers but again in the
interests of time I didn't prioritise this but again I have extensive experience graphing/animating
real time data using the charts_flutter package in my personal project

I really enjoyed this coding challenge and I'm looking forward to your feedback, thanks!
